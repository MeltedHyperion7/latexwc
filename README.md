# LATEXWC
Program to calculate word count of latex file.
I am new to latex, so this is definitely not fleshed out and probably won't work in every case.

# Installation instructions
- You need a ".latexwc" file in your home directory, which contains a list of tags
which contain text inside their associated curly braces. I hope to include a file in the future.
- run "make latexwc" in the project directory.
